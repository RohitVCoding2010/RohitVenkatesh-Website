        <p>Me being a programmmer and making this website, you might think that all I do is code, code and code.
          Let me tell you, you are surely mistaken. I have quite a few activites that I do apart from programming.
          The below list shows some of my facourite hobbies that are engrossing and entertaing in my opinion.
        </p>

      <div class="service-bottom">

          <div class="icon"><img src="https://img.icons8.com/bubbles/100/000000/services.png" /></div>
          <h2>Taekwondo</h2>
          <p>Taekwondo is a type of martial arts that had its origin in South Korea. When a person does Taekwondo,
            no.1 they are helping their body by being fit and working out on a daily bases. And no.2 you can take
            out all your anger on the bags you are kicking. :)
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="service-item">
          <div class="icon"><img src="https://img.icons8.com/bubbles/100/000000/services.png" /></div>
          <h2>Hiking</h2>
          <p>Hiking in my opinion is the best type of cardio for you body. It not only helps you lose weight quickly,
            but also is a great way of socializing. I love to hike with my family and friends since it is one of the best
            feelings in the entire world to just acknoledge nature.
          </p>
        </div>

          <div class="icon"><img src="https://img.icons8.com/bubbles/100/000000/services.png" /></div>
          <h2>Swimming</h2>
          <p>As a young kid, Swimming was one of my most favourite things to do over the summer. Even now as a teenager,
            I just love the feeling of swimming and the enjoyment you get out of it. I would not say that this is my favourite
            hobby, but its on the list.

          <h2>Dancing</h2>
          <p>Last but not the least, Dancing. I started dancing at the age of four and I always found dance interesting
            and calming, which is why is started a youtube channel called 'Rookie Rohit', Please consier liking and subscribing.
            Thank You :)

            <p>When I first got into scratch, I was 8. My 8 year old brain at the time, thought that I could just spend
              couple of hours moving code blocks and make a decent game. This was clearly false. It took me quite a while
              to understand whit this actually was. After a lot at practice and hardwork, I finally have an account in
              scratch with a decent amount of games. You can check it out by going to this link: 
              "https://scratch.mit.edu/users/RohitCoding2010/" or by searching RohitCoding2010 on scratch.

            <h2>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</h2>
            <p>My Python projects were pretty similar to my scratch projects but just on a different platform. I was
              introcuced to Python by my dad at the age of 10. For 10-years-me, it was a challenge becuase moving from
              code blocks to actually typing in the commands on VS code. Anyway, I have re-created some popular
              games such as Flappy Bird, Tetris, The Calculator App, Tic Tac Toe etc.

            <p>My favourite scratch project that I have made so far is Geometry Dash. Geometry Dash literally
              took me about 15 atempts to finally get right. It was a real challenge, but luckily I love chalenges.
              I turned my computer on and opened scratch with a lot of hope. Started coding it and ran into some
              minor bugs but that wasn't a big deal. After about 8 hours of srtaight programming that day, I was
              finally done Geometry Dash.

            <p>My Favourite Python Project took more effort than my favourite scratch project of create. My
              favourtie python project that I have made is chess. Yep, Chess. It literally took me forever to
              find pictures of the chess pieces itself and took me even longer to acutally write the code, in python,
              to actually make chess. Anyway, after a long time of coding, I finally finished programming chess in
              python.

            <p>The only html project I have made is this website itself. It took me a lot of learning to even start
              with html. But after quite a while, I figured it out anyway. The planning, coding and executing of 
              this website literally took ages. But, after a long time and a lot of patience from my partents, I
              publish this website on 2/4/2023.

        <p>Allow me to introduce myself! I am a student undergoing education in Wismer Public School, Markham, Ontario. 
          Primarily I love to code, learn, discover new interests and organise all things! As a student, who is now figuring
          out life, I am thrilled and delighted about the way this website turned out since it is my first website ever! 
          Speaking of this website, I am just now getting into html, css and js (programming languages, if you didn’t know).
          I would like to thank all of the teachers I have encountered in my life, including my parents, and the uncountable
          amount of knowledge I have gained by them. Overall, My simple motto to life is, ‘Work hand in silence, let your success make the noise’
          Thank You!.</p>
